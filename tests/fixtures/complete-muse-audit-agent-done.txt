⏺ Commit succeeded. Both research reports are now committed:

  1. research/skills-for-institutional-knowledge.md (commit
  7df1e3108) — Initial research covering knowledge audit,
  skills technical analysis, design proposals, and
  implementation recommendations.
  2. research/skills-deep-dive-mechanics.md (commit
  2a1bb801c) — Companion deep-dive covering rules loading
  mechanics, skill auto-invocation behavior, false
  positive/negative analysis, and a revised practical
  strategy recommending rules for guardrails (100% reliable)
   and skills for explicit workflows only.

  Key strategic recommendations from the research:
  - Use .claude/rules/ for critical guardrails (logging,
  memory management, concurrency) — always loaded, 100%
  reliable
  - Reserve skills for explicit workflow commands
  (translation, release prep) — not auto-invoked
  - Target 15-30 medium-granularity skills within the
  ~16,000 char description budget
  - The paths: conditional loading in rules is currently
  buggy (GitHub issue #16299), so treat all rules as
  globally loaded for now

  I HAVE COMPLETED THE GOAL

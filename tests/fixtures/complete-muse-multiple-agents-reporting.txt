  1. Create /research-feature skill first (biggest ROI for
  agent efficiency)
  2. Create /lessons-learned skill aggregating gotchas from
  bug analysis docs
  3. Create /core-data-patterns skill (most error-prone
  area)
  4. Slim down CLAUDE.md by moving localization content to
  .claude/rules/
  5. Eventually migrate from .claude/commands/ to
  .claude/skills/ directory structure

  The full report with concrete skill implementations is at
  research/skills-for-institutional-knowledge.md.

  stores. They teach agents when and how to consult existing
   docs at the right moments, rather than duplicating
  content.

  Proposed Architecture (3 Skill Categories)

  1. Investigative Skills — /research-feature, /check-docs —
   guide agents through systematic codebase discovery before
   implementing
  2. Pattern Skills — /ink-tool, /core-data-patterns,
  /card-implementation, /sync-debugging — encode proven
  implementation patterns with supporting reference files
  3. Guardrail Skills — /pre-implementation-check,
  /geometry-safety — auto-invoked to catch common mistakes

  Top Recommendations

  1. Create /research-feature skill first (biggest ROI for
  agent efficiency)
  2. Create /lessons-learned skill aggregating gotchas from
  bug analysis docs
  3. Create /core-data-patterns skill (most error-prone
  area)
  4. Slim down CLAUDE.md by moving localization content to
  .claude/rules/
  5. Eventually migrate from .claude/commands/ to
  .claude/skills/ directory structure

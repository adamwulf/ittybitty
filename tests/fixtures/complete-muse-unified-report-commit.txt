⏺ Done. The unified report is committed at b798fd193. Here's
   what changed:

  - research/skills-for-institutional-knowledge.md —
  Rewritten as a single consolidated report (703 lines → 703
   lines, reorganized)
  - research/skills-deep-dive-mechanics.md — Deleted

  The unified report flows as:
  1. Executive Summary — Updated with deep-dive conclusions
  2. Part 1: Knowledge Audit — Unchanged from original
  3. Part 2: Technical Analysis — Merged skills + rules +
  auto-invocation mechanics + context budget math
  4. Part 3: Rules vs Skills — Tradeoff analysis, false
  positive/negative data, granularity recommendations,
  decision matrix
  5. Part 4: Recommended Architecture — The revised version
  with rules for guardrails, skills for workflows, and
  explicit "What Was Dropped and Why" section
  6. Part 5: Implementation Plan — Updated phases (rules
  first, not lessons-learned)
  7. Part 6: Concrete Examples — Full skill implementations
  8. Appendices — Context budget, agent sharing, sources

  I HAVE COMPLETED THE GOAL

  4. researcher is usually spawned by research-pi - If
  research-pi is intercepted and becomes an ib agent, it
  would use ib new-agent --worker directly rather than Task.
   So researcher interception only matters if the primary
  Claude spawns one directly.
  5. Explore is lightweight - It only reads files, never
  writes. Native Task is arguably better for quick searches
  since ib agents have startup overhead (worktree, tmux,
  Claude boot). An ib new-agent takes 10-20 seconds vs
  near-instant native Task.

  My recommendation

  The current split is reasonable for the "redirect
  everything substantial" approach. But if you want to
  optimize:

  - Move Explore to skip list - It's fast, read-only, and
  the ib overhead hurts more than helps
  - Move Plan to skip list - Same reasoning, it's read-only
  research
  - Remove ib-merge from skip list - It's not a real
  subagent_type
  - Consider a default-skip approach - Only intercept known
  heavy types (general-purpose, feature-implementer,
  research-pi, researcher) instead of intercepting
  everything unknown

  Want me to make any of these adjustments?

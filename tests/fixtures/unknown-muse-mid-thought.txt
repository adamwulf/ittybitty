  - **View Controllers** (Muse/View Controllers/) -
  what patterns, gotchas, and rules matter here?
  - **Views** (Muse/Views/) - what's different about
  working on views vs controllers?
  - **Interactions** (Muse/Interactions/) - gesture
  handling, selection, drag/drop rules
  - **Data/persistence layer** - whatever the actual
  persistence mechanism is (NOT Core Data)
  - **Sync/Network** (Muse/Service
  Workers/SyncNetwork/, NetworkConnection/,
  NetworkModel/) - sync architecture rules
  - **Import/Export** (Muse/Import & Export/) - bundle
  format, translation behavior
  - **Extensions** - app extensions like MuseShare
  - **LogDriver and automerge packages** - the sibling
  repos

  ### What I want:
  For each area, propose a rule file with:
  1. The exact `paths:` glob that would trigger it
  (using CSV format, not YAML arrays)
  2. The specific knowledge/guardrails agents need when
   working in that area
  3. References to relevant docs/ files for deeper
  reading

  For example, if an agent starts editing files in the
  sync network, it should automatically

⏺ This is a substantial research task. I'll explore the
  actual codebase in parallel across all the areas you
  listed. Let me launch exploration agents for each area
  simultaneously.

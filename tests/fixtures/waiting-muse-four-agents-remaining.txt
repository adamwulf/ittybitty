⏺ All 7 exploration agents are actively working. I'll wait
  for them to complete before synthesizing findings. Let me
  set up task tracking for this work.
  ⎿  PreToolUse:TaskCreate hook returned blocking error
  ⎿  TaskCreate is not available. Use ib new-agent --worker
     to spawn worker agents instead.

⏺ All 7 agents still running. I'll wait for them to finish
  before proceeding with the report updates.

  CRDT system built on SQLite, not Core Data. Waiting for
  the remaining 6 agents.

  WAITING

⏺ LastWriteMerge exploration complete. Now I have both
  persistence layer packages understood. Waiting for the

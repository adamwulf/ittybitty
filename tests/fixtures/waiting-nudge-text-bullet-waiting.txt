⏺ WAITING

❯ When you stop working, you must always end your
  message with either 'WAITING' or 'I HAVE COMPLETED
  THE GOAL'. IMPORTANT: Write your summary or status
  update FIRST, then put the status phrase as your
  FINAL line - nothing should come after it. If you are
   waiting for input or have nothing more to do without
   further instruction, say 'WAITING'. If you have
  completed your goal, say 'I HAVE COMPLETED THE GOAL'.
   If you have neither completed your goal nor are
  waiting, then please resume your work.

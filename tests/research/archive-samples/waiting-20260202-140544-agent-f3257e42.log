❯ <ittybitty>You are an IttyBitty worker
  agent.</ittybitty>

  [AGENT CONTEXT]
  You are running as agent agent-f3257e42 in a git
  worktree on branch agent/agent-f3257e42, forked from
  agent/fumble.
  Your manager agent is: fumble

  PATH ISOLATION:
  You are isolated to your worktree at:
  /Users/adamwulf/Developer/muse/muse-ios/.ittybitty/ag
  ents/agent-f3257e42/repo
  - You CAN access: Your worktree, ~/.claude, /tmp, and
  general system paths
  - You CANNOT access: The main repo at
  /Users/adamwulf/Developer/muse/muse-ios, other
  agents' worktrees
  - If you get "Access denied" or "Path violation"
  errors, you're trying to access a forbidden path
  - Do NOT try to cd into the main repo - work only in
  your worktree

  GIT WORKTREE CONTEXT:
  You are in a git worktree, which shares the same
  repository as the main checkout.
  - Your branch: agent/agent-f3257e42
  - Forked from: agent/fumble
  - All branches are LOCAL - no need for 'git fetch
  origin'
  - To merge latest changes from your parent: 'git
  merge agent/fumble' (not 'git fetch origin; git merge
  origin/...')
  - Other agents' branches are visible as local
  branches (agent/*)
  - Your worktree is a separate checkout, but commits
  are shared across all worktrees

  You are a worker agent focused on your specific task.
  IMPORTANT: Always use 'ib' (not './ib') to ensure you
  use the current version from PATH.

  To communicate with your manager: ib send fumble
  "your message"

  Use this to:
  - Report completion or progress
  - Ask questions if requirements are unclear
  - Share important findings

  If you get stuck or encounter a blocker:
  1. Describe the specific problem you're facing
  2. Send a message to your manager: ib send fumble
  "[STUCK] <description of problem>"
  3. Enter WAITING state - a watchdog monitors you and
  will notify your manager that you need help

  SELF-INSPECTION:
  Before completing, verify your work:
  ib diff         Check your changes vs base branch
  ib status       See your commits

  State Management:
  - Whenever you stop working and are idle, you must
  end your message with either:
  - 'WAITING' - if waiting for input or have nothing
  more to do without further instruction
  - 'I HAVE COMPLETED THE GOAL' - if you have
  completed your task
  - CRITICAL: These phrases MUST be the LAST thing you
  output. Put any summaries or status updates BEFORE
  these phrases, never after.

  When your task is complete:
  1. Commit any changes you made (git add && git
  commit)
  2. FIRST: Write your summary of what you accomplished
  3. LAST: Say the exact phrase: "I HAVE COMPLETED THE
  GOAL"
  This phrase MUST be the final line - nothing after
  it.
  This signals to your manager agent that you are
  done.
  4. Wait for your manager to merge or kill your
  session.

  [USER TASK]
  Worker 1: Read the CLAUDE.md file and summarize the
  key points about localization. Enter WAITING state
  when done with your summary.

⏺ I'll read the CLAUDE.md file to summarize the key points
  about localization.

⏺ Read(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 779 lines

⏺ Summary: Localization Key Points from CLAUDE.md

  1. Language Support

  - Source language: English (en)
  - Complete translations (679/679 strings): German (de),
  Spanish (es), French (fr), Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans),
  Traditional Chinese - Taiwan (zh-Hant), Traditional
  Chinese - Hong Kong (zh-HK), Ukrainian (uk)

  2. File Structure

  Muse/Localizable.xcstrings       # Main app strings (~679
  keys)
  Muse/AppStore.xcstrings          # App Store metadata (50
  keys)
  Muse/InfoPlist.xcstrings         # App bundle info strings
  MuseShare/Localizable.xcstrings  # Share extension (8
  keys)
  Screenshots.xcstrings            # Screenshot/onboarding
  content
  Tutorials.xcstrings              # Tutorial content

  3. Translation Tools

  - translation_helper.rb: Main CLI tool for managing
  translations
    - --stats, --missing, --search, --update, --json-update,
   --batch-json
  - translation_overview.py: Progress tracking across all
  files
  - check_translation_variations.py: Validate device/plural
  variations

  4. Critical Guidelines

  - Brand names: NEVER translate "Muse" or "Muse Share"
  - MD5 keys: Use for strings with apostrophes, quotes, or
  special UTF-8 characters to avoid parsing issues
  - Preserve formatting: Keep placeholders (%@, %d), HTML
  tags, command symbols (⌘, ⇧) exactly as-is
  - Length constraints: Keep translations close to English
  length for UI compatibility

  5. CLDR Plural Rules
  ┌────────────────┬───────────────────┐
  │    Language    │ Plural Categories │
  ├────────────────┼───────────────────┤
  │ Chinese (zh-*) │ other only        │
  ├────────────────┼───────────────────┤
  │ German (de)    │ one, other        │
  ├────────────────┼───────────────────┤
  │ French (fr)    │ one, many, other  │
  ├────────────────┼───────────────────┤
  │ Spanish (es)   │ one, other        │
  ├────────────────┼───────────────────┤
  │ English (en)   │ one, other        │
  └────────────────┴───────────────────┘
  6. Device Variations (36 total)

  - Mac: Use "click" language (点击 in Chinese)
  - iOS/iPad: Use "tap" language (轻点 in Chinese)

  7. Variation Statistics

  - 36 device variations (Mac vs iOS text)
  - 4 plural variations
  - 40 total variation strings (~5.9% require special
  handling)

  8. Adding New Languages Process

  1. Determine BCP 47 language code
  2. Research CLDR plural rules at unicode.org
  3. Add translation guidelines to AppStore.xcstrings
  4. Use translation_helper.rb for translations

  9. Safety Features

  - Script never creates new keys
  - Batch validation before changes
  - Git version control for backups
